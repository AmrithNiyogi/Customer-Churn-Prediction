## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a Customer Churn Prediction & Email Automation System that predicts customer churn using machine learning and automates personalized email outreach for at-risk customers.

### 1.2 Scope
The system will:
- Use machine learning models to predict customer churn.
- Compare different models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, ANN, and Auto-Sklearn) to determine the best approach.
- Deploy the best model as a Flask API for real-time predictions.
- Automate personalized retention emails for customers identified as at risk.
- Track email responses to assess engagement.

### 1.3 Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries & Frameworks: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras, Auto-Sklearn, Flask
- Email Automation: smtplib, imaplib
- Database: Pandas for customer data processing
- Deployment: Flask API, Joblib for model persistence

## 2. Functional Requirements
### 2.1 Data Preprocessing
- Load and clean customer data.
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Encode categorical features using OneHotEncoder/LabelEncoder.
- Normalize numerical features using StandardScaler.
- Split data into training and testing sets.

### 2.2 Model Training & Evaluation
- Implement and train the following models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier
  - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
  - Auto-Sklearn for automated model selection
 
- Evaluate models using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC-AUC Score

- Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

### 2.3 Model Deployment
- Save the best model using Joblib or TensorFlow.
- Develop a Flask API to:
  - Accept customer data as input.
  - Return churn predictions in real-time.
  - Integrate with customer management systems.

### 2.4 Email Automation
- Identify customers predicted to churn (`y_pred == 1`).
- Send personalized retention emails using smtplib.
- Track email responses via imaplib.
- Log email interactions for analysis.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Performance
- Model prediction should take less than 1 second per request.
- API should handle at least 100 concurrent requests.

### 3.2 Security
- Encrypt sensitive customer data.
- Secure Flask API endpoints using authentication mechanisms.

### 3.3 Scalability
- Design system to handle large datasets efficiently.
- Enable future integration with cloud platforms for scalability.

---

## 4. System Design
### 4.1 Architecture
- Frontend: Not required (API-based system)
- Backend: Flask API for churn prediction and email automation
- Database: Pandas DataFrame (extendable to SQL/NoSQL if needed)
- Machine Learning Pipeline: Data Preprocessing → Model Training → Model Deployment → Prediction

### 4.2 API Endpoints
- POST /predict → Accepts customer data, returns churn prediction.
- POST /send-email → Triggers email automation for at-risk customers.
- GET /email-status → Retrieves email engagement metrics.
